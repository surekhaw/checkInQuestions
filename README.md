## Random Check-In Question Generator

At The Last Mile, we start every meeting with an icebreaker, which we call a "check-in question."  At times it can be difficult to think of an appropriate question that will get everyone engaged.  To resolve this issue, I created this Random Check-In Question Generator, which randomly displays a check-in question upon clicking the button.  

Instructions:
Click on the "Display Question" button to display the first check-in question. If the user does not like the check-in question displayed, they can just click on the "New Question" button to display another randomly chosen question.  If the user looks through all the check-in questions, a message will display advising the user that there are no more check-in questions currently available.

Responsiveness:
The project uses CSS grid and is responsive so that it will display uniformly on any browser width

Deployment:
The Random Check-In Question Generator App is now deployed on Heroku!
